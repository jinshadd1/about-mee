 About Me

**Name:** Jinshad k

Hi! I’m a multimedia student who loves exploring technology and creative media. Recently, I learned about **Cloud Computing**, which is an important part of IT today.

Cloud computing means storing and accessing data or applications over the internet instead of a local computer. A real-world example is **Google Drive**, where I can upload my files and access them from anywhere using any device.

Learning this concept helped me understand how modern apps and services work behind the scenes, making life and work much easier for everyone.
